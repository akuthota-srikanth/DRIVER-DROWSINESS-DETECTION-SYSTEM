DRIVER DROWSINESS-DETECTION SYSTEM BASED ON TRANSFER LEARNING 
AND MC-KCF 
### Project Overview:
- **Problem**: Around 1.3 million people die each year due to car accidents, primarily caused by driver distraction and drowsiness.
- **Objective**: Develop a system to detect driver drowsiness using modern technologies, such as face detection and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to improve road safety and prevent accidents.

### Key Features:
- **Camera Integration**: A camera is used to capture the driver’s facial features.
- **Face Detection**: The system uses face detection algorithms to track the driver’s face in real-time.
- **Drowsiness Detection**: CNN-based techniques are employed to analyze the driver's facial expressions and detect signs of drowsiness.
- **Alert Mechanism**: When drowsiness is detected, an alarm is triggered to alert the driver, encouraging them to take a break or perform precautionary actions.
  
### Technologies Used:
- **Face Detection**: OpenCV or Haar Cascades.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: For analyzing facial features and detecting signs of drowsiness.
- **Alarm System**: An auditory alert system for warning the driver when drowsiness is detected.

### Impact:
- **Improved Road Safety**: Reduces the likelihood of accidents caused by driver fatigue.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks the driver's attentiveness throughout their driving time.
  
### Future Improvements:
- **Integration with Vehicle Systems**: Possible integration with vehicle control systems for automated actions like slowing down or stopping.
- **Enhanced Detection**: Adding more sensors or data sources (e.g., eye tracking, heart rate monitoring) for more accurate detection.
